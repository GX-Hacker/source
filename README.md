# Source code for my other repos

WARNING: Do not directly try do download and use, **unless you know what you are doing**. This is the source code, not the regular downloads. This repository should be used by others **for contribution purposes only**, and not for regular usage. By using the source code locally, you won't get automatic updates (if there are) and things may not work as expected.

If you are trying to find the direct downloads, go to the other repos like [Discord Themes](https://github.com/gx-hacker/discord-themes) or [Browser Styles](https://github.com/gx-hacker/browser-styles), or you can view my profile to see all the other repos available. You can also [read the wiki](https://github.com/gx-hacker/home/wiki).
